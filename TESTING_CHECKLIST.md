## Edge Case Testing

### Score Display Visibility

- [ ] Score increases when unlocking features
- [ ] Final score matches breakdown math
- [ ] Multiplier never below 0.25
- [ ] Multiplier never above 2.00

## Browser Console Tests

**Open DevTools (F12) and run:**

```javascript
// Test 1: Check score display is working
document.getElementById('score-display').style.display;
// Should be: "flex" during gameplay, "none" otherwise

// Test 2: Verify timer is running
const startTime = IdleAnts.game.sessionStartTime;
const elapsed = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
console.log('Elapsed seconds:', elapsed);

// Test 3: Calculate current score manually
const gameData = {
    resourceManager: IdleAnts.game.resourceManager,
    achievementManager: IdleAnts.game.achievementManager,
    dailyChallengeManager: IdleAnts.game.dailyChallengeManager,
    game: IdleAnts.game
};
const score = IdleAnts.game.leaderboardManager.calculateScore(gameData);
const breakdown = IdleAnts.game.leaderboardManager.getLastScoreBreakdown();
console.log('Score:', score);
console.log('Breakdown:', breakdown);

// Test 4: Verify multiplier formula
const minutes = elapsed / 60;
const multiplier = Math.max(0.25, 2.0 - (minutes / 10));
console.log('Minutes:', minutes, 'Multiplier:', multiplier);
```

## Performance Testing

### During Gameplay
- [ ] Score updates smoothly (no lag)
- [ ] Timer increments without skips
- [ ] UI doesn't cause frame drops
- [ ] Works on mobile devices

### Memory Leaks
- [ ] Play for 30+ minutes
- [ ] Check browser memory usage
- [ ] Score display doesn't accumulate elements

## Accessibility Testing

### Visual
- [ ] Score display readable on all backgrounds
- [ ] Colors distinguish good/bad multipliers
- [ ] Stars visible and clear
- [ ] Text size appropriate

### Mobile
- [ ] Score display fits on phone screens
- [ ] Touch doesn't interfere with score panel
- [ ] Readable in portrait and landscape

## Final Verification

**The Two-Player Test:**

Have two people play simultaneously:
- Player A: Speedrun (5 minutes)
- Player B: Optimal (10 minutes)

**Player A Expected:**
- Lower base score
- Higher multiplier
- Potentially lower final score

**Player B Expected:**
- Higher base score
- 1.0x multiplier
- Likely higher final score

**Result:** Player B should win if both play equally well, teaching that 10 minutes is the sweet spot.
